Gerrit is an open-source code collaboration tool, built on top of Git. The purpose of Gerrit is to make code-review easier. To unpack that a little: when we use Git, we are properly using a source-control system, or better yet, a filesystem built to be used as a source-control system. To unpack that a little: you can think of Git as the engine under the hood that allows us to manage and do version control, and you can think of Gerrit as a layer on top of that engine built to make certain functions easier. In particular, Gerrit is built to make code review easier. Recall that, whenever we make a pull request, the request must be approved before it can be merged into the repo. The approval step of a pull request is where the code is reviewed by all interested parties. The main purpose of Gerrit is to make that review step easier.

Setting up a Gerrit server on Windows begins with having the JDK installed. Gerrit is written in Java, so you need the jdk to run it. To ensure that Gerrit can access the JDK, make sure to add the folder containing the JDK to your PATH variable. In Windows, this means opening up the system environment variables (accessible by typing "system environment variables" into the Start menu), locating the PATH variable, and adding the JDK directory thereto. Remember that the JDK directory on Windows is under Program Files/Java/Bin, and that this directory must be added to the variable named PATH in order to make the JDK available to Gerrit and your preferred terminal application.

Once you've made the JDK available to Gerrit and to your terminal application, you can open your terminal and cd into the directory where you've installed Gerrit. Since this document assumes a Windows install, we can assume that you've installed the Gerrit .war file into a folder named "Gerrit" in your Git directory. Once you've CD'd in, you can run the command, java -jar gerrit-2.14.4.war init -d . in order to extract all of the necessary files.
