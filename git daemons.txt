The big difference between git and other versioning systems is its decentralized nature. There is no central repository in git and the git tools do not assume one. You can FUNCTIONALLY have a central repository, of course, and most projects will have something like that, but it is nowhere written into the software that things must work that way. Git is ESSENTIALLY decentralized, and any repository designated as the central or official repository is that way only by fiat.
Accordingly, there is absolutely nothing stopping you from running a git daemon and allowing your local repository to act as the remote repo for someone else who is allowed to connect to your computer, e.g. by ssh. The details of implementation will vary from OS to OS, and by user preference of course.
The way to set up a git daemon of this kind is to run  git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/srv/git/ /srv/git/ in a "daemonized" fashion. "Daemonize" is a term common to Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Linux) which simply means "to run as a Unix daemon." If the reader is unfamiliar, a daemon is any process that runs in the background of a computer for purposes that make direct user control unnecessary.
