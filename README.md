The Illustrated Guide to Git, or some such title.

TO DO

The idea of this book is basically a progressive difficulty as you go forward. Begin with a nice cartoony kindergarteny explanation in chapter 1 that covers all the basic git commands. This chapter is suitable for the incompetent do-nothing turkeys in management. Even they will get it.

Chapter two will strip away all the pedagogic devices and just leave the bare syntactic structure, which will be very skeletal since chapter one is the most gentle introduction possible. Chapter two will explain a little more about branching, commits, merging, cherry-pick, and some of the more complicated commands. It will also get a little more fundamental in explaining what git does and does not track, in order to make the commands make sense. It won't be TOO fundamental, though, because that level of understanding isn't available to your 120 code monkey.

Chapter three will be much more fundamental -- I can't foresee past this point because I need to learn more git. I'm gonna keep it up though.
